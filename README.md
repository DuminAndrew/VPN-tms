## About Project
Our project is a virtual private network (VPN) with advanced traffic masking and end-to-end data encryption capabilities. The main goal of the project is to create the most anonymous VPN service that allows you to conveniently and safely mask your traffic on the Internet.

Main features:
Traffic masking: Users will be able to redirect their Internet traffic through our network, which will ensure anonymity and protection of personal information in the online space.

Data encryption: The end-to-end encryption method provides reliable protection of transmitted data from unauthorized access and eavesdropping.

Client-server architecture: The application is divided into two components â€” client and server applications. The client application is installed on the user's computer, and the server application is installed on a remote server.

Unique encryption keys: When the client application connects to the server, unique encryption keys are exchanged, which guarantees the security of data transmission.

Setting up a session: Users have the option to customize their session settings, including the encryption level and the choice of connection endpoint.

This project has been developed taking into account the importance of privacy and security on the Internet. We strive to provide users with tools that will allow them to feel protected and anonymous in the online space.
